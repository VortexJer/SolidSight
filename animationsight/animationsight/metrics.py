      * OVERLAP: the last frame duplicates the first (gap ~ 0);
      * FULL:    the last frame is one step BEFORE the first, because
                 playback wraps N-1 -> 0 (gap ~ one frame of motion).

    Judging against zero reports every correctly authored full-loop as
    broken — a false positive, and false positives are how a tool loses
    the right to be believed. So the gap is compared against the clip's
    own median per-frame motion, and 'discontinuous' means the seam
    jumps by MORE than a normal frame does.
