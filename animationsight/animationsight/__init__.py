"""animationsight — animation review built exclusively for AI agents.

An agent cannot watch an animation. It can read numbers. So: a clip in,
and out come exact velocities, accelerations, jerk, angular rates,
contact events, foot sliding, balance against the support base, ground
penetration, smoothness and loop continuity — plus renders of the exact
frames the findings point at.
