"""shadersight — shader review built exclusively for AI agents.

A shader is judged by rendering a sphere and looking. But what is
actually WRONG with a material is physics: energy conservation,
Helmholtz reciprocity, positivity - laws, not opinions, and all of them
integrals over the hemisphere. And a node graph's problems are graph
theory: cycles, dead nodes, per-pixel cost. So compute them.
