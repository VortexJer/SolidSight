# solidsight

**A 3D design tool built exclusively for AI agents.** Parametric Python in;
deterministic geometry, multi-angle PNG renders, and a machine-readable
validation report out.

An LLM writing CAD code is blind: it can reason about geometry but cannot see
what it made. Human CAD tools assume eyes on a screen and a hand on a mouse.
solidsight closes the loop the way an agent needs it closed — every build
produces images to *look at* and exact numbers to *check*, plus errors written
to be read by a model, not a human at a console.

```
write code  ->  solidsight build  ->  renders + report.json  ->  inspect  ->  adjust  ->  repeat
```

## Same prompt, with and without the tool

*"Make a detailed 3D model of an inline-4 engine block"* — once as a blind
one-shot by a fresh-context agent (plain Python + trimesh, no renders, no
validation: what a bare agent does), once through solidsight's loop. Same
kinds of mistakes on both sides; the loop is the difference between
shipping them and catching them. The blind result ended convinced of
success (`is_watertight: True`) — the audit found its main oil gallery
tangent to the block's outer face (a 0.45 mm skin over a pressurized oil
line), oil drain-backs that dead-end inside a wall 1.0 mm from the water
jacket, and a crankcase open to the outside through a slot a ray crosses
with **0 crossings**.

## Quickstart (30 seconds)

```bash
pip install "git+https://github.com/VortexJer/AISight#subdirectory=solidsight"
# or from a checkout:  pip install ./solidsight

cat > model.py <<'EOF'
from solidsight import *
plate = rect(60, 40).round_corners(4).extrude(5)
hole = cylinder(h=7, d=4.5).translate(0, 0, -1)
plate = plate - parts.grid_pattern(hole, 2, 2, 44, 28).translate(-22, -14, 0)
boss = parts.standoff(h=8, od=8, id_=3.2)
emit(plate + boss, name="plate")
EOF

solidsight build model.py --print-safe --stl
# -> out/renders/01_iso.png ... 04_top.png   (look at these)
# -> out/report.json                          (volume, walls, overhangs, checks)
# -> out/stl/plate.stl
```

The build summary ends with the tool's whole philosophy in one line:
`NEXT: open the renders and LOOK at them, then read report.json checks.`

## What the agent gets on every build

- **Renders** — orthographic PNGs (iso/front/right/top + more, turntable,
  exploded view), one muted color per named part with an on-image legend,
  sharp-edge overlay, 10 mm ground grid, axis triad, exact bbox dimensions
  and a scale bar burned into every frame. Deterministic software rasterizer:
  no GPU, no OpenGL, byte-identical output for identical input.
- **report.json** — per part: exact volume, surface area, bbox, center of
  mass, shell count, genus, watertightness, minimum wall thickness (with the
  coordinates of the thinnest point), overhang analysis, sealed-cavity
  detection. Per pair of parts: exact collision bbox + volume + a concrete
  move suggestion, or the minimum clearance between surfaces. Every finding
  carries `where` and a `try:` suggestion.
- **Cross-sections** — `--slice z=5` renders the filled section; internal
  walls and fits are invisible from outside.
- **Exact spatial queries** (no vision needed):
  `solidsight query model.py point|ray|section|voxels ...` — point
  classification, ray crossings with per-wall thicknesses, ASCII material
  grids, voxel grids with flood-fill cavity detection.
- **Errors written for LLMs** — what failed, where (file:line, names,
  coordinates, bounding boxes), and what to try next. Never "invalid
  geometry".

## Before / after: one turn of the loop

Real, committed output from [`05-assembly`](skill/examples/05-assembly): a
divider tray was designed 8 mm too tall and pokes through the closed lid.

<p align="center">
  <img src="skill/examples/05-assembly/out_collision/renders/01_iso.png" width="45%">
  <img src="skill/examples/05-assembly/out/renders/01_iso.png" width="45%">
</p>
<p align="center"><em>before: the tray (green) pierces the lid &nbsp;·&nbsp; after: seated under the lip with declared clearance</em></p>

**Before** — the agent doesn't have to *see* it; the report says exactly
what, where and how much:

```
[WARN] parts "lid" and "card" occupy the same space (160 mm3 of overlap)
       where: overlap bbox x -20..20, y 4.2..5.8, z 24..26.5
       try:   move 'card' 1.7 mm along y, or rework the joint; ...
```

**After** — one edit later, the declared spec holds:

```
pair 'box' <-> 'lid':  touching, clearance 0.0 mm   [spec MET: touching]
pair 'card' <-> 'lid': clear, clearance 0.2 mm      [spec MET: clearance >= 0.15 mm]
```

**And the change is auditable** — `solidsight diff before/ after/`:

```
diff: model_collision.py [warnings] -> model.py [ok]
  part 'card': volume 1536.0 -> 1024.0 (-512.0 mm3); size [40.0, 1.6, 24.0] -> [40.0, 1.6, 16.0]
  part 'box': unchanged        part 'lid': unchanged
  GONE [WARN] parts "lid" and "card" occupy the same space (160 mm3 of overlap)
  render 01_iso.png: 0.3% of pixels differ
```

The edit did what it meant — and provably nothing else.

## The engineering platform (v0.6)

Everything an autonomous agent needs from concept to manufacturing, all
deterministic and headless:

- **Live mode** — `solidsight watch` rebuilds on save with provable
  skips (exact scene fingerprints); `solidsight view` serves an
  interactive viewer (isolate, x-ray, section planes, explode, finding
  markers with fly-to, two-point measuring) that hot-reloads on every
  successful rebuild. It opens as an **app window** (Chromium `--app`:
  no tab strip, no address bar, own taskbar entry; `--tab` for a normal
  tab), takes the next free port when yours is busy and says which,
  ships geometry as binary `mesh.bin` (a 22 MB JSON scene became a few
  MB of typed arrays), and writes `status.json` — pid, url, state,
  build count — so a caller can tell "still serving" from "crashed"
  without killing it. Self-contained: vendored three.js, no CDN.
- **Progress everywhere** — `--progress` live stage lines (%, ETA) and
  `--events file.ndjson` structured streams; artifacts stay
  byte-deterministic.
- **Formats** — STL, 3MF, OBJ, GLB (combined GLB keeps part names +
  colors), DXF/SVG section outlines, `solidsight convert`.
- **Real components** — an offline database of ~70 real parts with the
  standards' exact dimensions: `solidsight components search "m4 socket
  head"` → `parts.component("iso4762_m4", length=16)`. Plus catalog
  generators for bearings, NEMA motors, GT2 pulleys, MGN rails, T-slot
  extrusions, springs, shafts, servos.
- **Engineering outputs** — `solidsight drawing` (dimensioned
  third-angle PDF with true hidden lines and a hole table),
  `solidsight robot` (joint() → URDF/SDF with exact inertials),
  `solidsight motion` (sweep joints through limits → exact collision
  map).
- **Reasoning & review** — `query distance`, `fit 8 H7 g6` (real
  ISO 286), `explain <check-id>`, `critique` (design review with fix
  menus and a verified-good list), `cost` (FDM/SLA/CNC estimates),
  `assembly` (BOM, axis play, assembly sequence).
- **Extensible & measurable** — plugin entry points
  (`solidsight.plugins`, crash-isolated) and a graded benchmark suite
  (`benchmarks/`, six commissions with machine-checkable expectations).

## Two validation modes

- `--print-safe` — for parts that will be manufactured: enforces watertight,
  single shell per part, minimum wall thickness, no sealed cavities; warns on
  overhangs and floating parts. Non-zero exit code on failure, so CI works.
- `--free` (default) — visual/artistic exploration: same metrics reported,
  nothing enforced.

## Scope: parts and machines — not styling

solidsight is a CSG kernel driven by code, and it is at its best where a
shape is *specified*: brackets, enclosures, mechanisms, gears, engine
internals, fixtures, furniture, robots — anything whose correctness is a
number (a wall, a clearance, a centre distance, a hole pattern, a print
angle). There the loop is decisive: the report finds what nobody can see
and the diff proves the fix did only what you meant.

**It is bad at styled organic surfaces** — cars, character bodies,
sculpted consumer shells, anything whose acceptance test is *"does it
look like the photo"*. Not a matter of trying harder; it is what the
stack cannot do:

- **No surface modelling.** No NURBS patches, no subdivision, no
  sculpting, no curvature-continuous (class-A) blends, no 3D fillet
  across arbitrary edges — `round_corners`/`offset` live in 2D sketches.
  Booleans of primitives plus station lofts give faceted shoulders and
  hard transitions exactly where a car body needs continuity.
- **The report measures manufacturability, not likeness.** Watertight,
  single shell, 0 findings, every spec met — and it can still look
  nothing like the car. `--ref` prints a reference-vs-render sheet, but
  nothing in the tool *scores* resemblance; that judgement stays with
  the human eye, which is the one thing this tool was built to replace.
- **Details on a curved body are hand-carved.** Glass, lights, grilles,
  trim and shutlines have to be cut out of the body shell with booleans
  against an eroded copy of itself, each one a fight with coincident
  faces and z-fighting — and the piece count grows far faster than the
  loop can iterate (a full body scene is minutes per build, not
  seconds).
- **Likeness is per-piece work.** Getting a mirror or a headlight to
  read as the real part takes its own commission, its own photos and
  its own iterations; a car is fifty of those, and any one that looks
  wrong ruins the whole.

Rule of thumb: **if the acceptance test is a caliper, use solidsight; if
it is an eye, don't.** For styled exteriors expect a recognisable
massing at best — [`04-vase`](skill/examples/04-vase) and
[`09-coupe-body`](skill/examples/09-coupe-body) are that honest ceiling,
not a finished product — and take the real surfacing to a sub-D /
NURBS modeller.

## Images as input

The agent has eyes; the kernel does not. `image_outline()` traces the
dark shapes of a photo or drawing into an exact sketch (holes preserved,
real size declared by the agent — pixels carry no millimetres), and
`image_heightfield()` turns brightness into a watertight relief solid
(lithophanes, terrain). Building with `--ref photo.png` adds a
reference-vs-render comparison sheet to every build, so the loop closes
against the source image. Example: [`08-from-image`](skill/examples/08-from-image).

`image_outline` is for *flat* art. Pointed at a photograph it used to
trace the texture — 19,194 contours from one car photo, 42 s just to
extrude — so it now caps the trace resolution and refuses a shredded
result with the counts and the way out (threshold the image, raise
`min_area`, or use `profile_read()`, which is the one built to measure
photographed silhouettes).

## The Claude Code skill

[`skill/SKILL.md`](skill/SKILL.md) teaches an agent the full workflow — bill
of parts before code, catalog before derivation, build-and-look after every
change, exact queries when eyes are not enough, the assembly
collision/clearance loop, detail mode for faithful technical models, and a
definition-of-done checklist.

Beneath it, [`skill/domains/`](skill/domains) carries **12 deep domain
playbooks** — enclosures, mechanisms, product design, furniture,
architecture, vehicles, organic, terrain, jewelry/miniatures, game-ready
assets, toys, scientific — each with the numbers a domain expert would
assume (heat-set insert holes, gear centre distances, NACA profiles,
stair rules, ring sizes, the small-parts choking cylinder, triangle
budgets), the build order, the failure modes, and its own definition of
done. The agent loads exactly the one that matches the request. (The
vehicles and organic playbooks are subject to the same ceiling as the
[Scope](#scope-parts-and-machines--not-styling) section: they teach
correct proportions and build order, not class-A surfacing.)

**It installs itself.** The skill ships inside the pip package: the first
`solidsight` command on a machine with Claude Code drops it into
`~/.claude/skills/solidsight` and keeps it updated. From then on, any 3D
design request in Claude Code routes through it. Manual control:

```bash
solidsight install-skill        # (re)install explicitly
solidsight uninstall            # remove the skill AND the package
```

## Parametric parts catalog

`solidsight catalog` lists battle-tested components so agents compose instead
of re-deriving: involute spur gears, ISO threads/bolts/nuts, print-in-place
hinges, cantilever snap clips + slots, boxes with fitted lids, uniform-wall
containers, standoffs, hex vent cutters + honeycomb panels, linear/grid/
circular patterns, 3D tube sweeps (`tube_path`), 2D ribbon curves
(`stroke`), and real text (emboss/engrave) from the bundled font.

The whole stack was hardened by **blind dogfooding**: five design commissions
executed using only the skill and the CLI (no knowledge of the internals),
with every point of friction fixed at the root — 16 findings, from a
silently-broken shading fallback to false positives in the wall-thickness
metric. Each real bug is pinned by a regression test in `tool/tests/`
(see `CHANGELOG.md`).

## Examples (all outputs generated by the tool, committed as proof)

| example | shows |
|---|---|
| [`01-mounting-bracket`](skill/examples/01-mounting-bracket) | primitives, patterns, print-safe |
| [`02-snap-box`](skill/examples/02-snap-box) | booleans, snap-fit clip/slot pairing |
| [`03-gear-train`](skill/examples/03-gear-train) | catalog gears; pair clearance proves the mesh (0.19 mm backlash) |
| [`04-vase`](skill/examples/04-vase) | organic twisted form in `--free` mode |
| [`05-assembly`](skill/examples/05-assembly) | multi-part assembly; intentional collision caught with exact bbox/volume, then fixed with measured clearances |
| [`06-hidden-cavity`](skill/examples/06-hidden-cavity) | a sealed cavity invisible in renders, caught by the report and provable via `query ray`/`voxels` |
| [`07-engine-block`](skill/examples/07-engine-block) | **detail mode**: a faithful inline-4 block (bores, liner steps, head-bolt matrix, water jacket, cam tunnel, oil galleries, pan rail, gussets, filter pad, inclined mounts) built region-by-region from a feature specification |
| [`08-from-image`](skill/examples/08-from-image) | **from an image**: a user's emblem traced with `image_outline` and engraved, built with the `--ref` comparison sheet |
| [`09-coupe-body`](skill/examples/09-coupe-body) | **styled bodywork — and the tool's ceiling**: a 2024-coupe-proportioned one-piece body by station lofting (`loft_sections`, concave shoulder sections, carved arches). Correct proportions and a clean single shell; *not* a class-A exterior — see [Scope](#scope-parts-and-machines--not-styling) |

## Stack and why

| layer | choice | why |
|---|---|---|
| geometry kernel | [manifold3d](https://github.com/elalish/manifold) | guaranteed-manifold CSG, exact booleans, deterministic, fast, pip-installable everywhere. Not reinvented here — solidsight's value is the feedback loop on top. |
| mesh analysis | [trimesh](https://trimsh.org) | mass properties, adjacency, watertightness |
| rendering | own numpy z-buffer rasterizer + Pillow | zero GPU/driver dependencies, headless on any CI, fully deterministic — the reasons pyrender/OpenGL were rejected |
| text | matplotlib's font machinery | bundled DejaVu font = identical glyph geometry on every machine |

Alternatives considered: **JSCAD** (JS kernel is solid but headless PNG
rendering in Node needs GPU or fragile native deps), **build123d/OCCT** (real
BREP fillets, but a heavyweight install and less cross-platform determinism),
**trimesh-only** (boolean robustness depends on external engines). Manifold
hits the sweet spot: robust, light, deterministic.

## Design principles

1. Code is the design language — parametric primitives, booleans,
   transforms. No hand-edited meshes, no GUI.
2. The agent is blind until it renders — so rendering + reporting is the
   core feature, not an add-on.
3. Total determinism — same input, byte-identical output. Agents can trust
   their mental model; CI can diff artifacts.
4. Errors are for LLMs — specific, located, actionable.
5. Don't reinvent the kernel — reinvent the feedback loop.
