description: "Use whenever the user asks to design, model, CAD, or 3D-print a physical part, enclosure, mechanism, or assembly — or to inspect/fix an existing solidsight model. Parametric Python in; deterministic geometry, PNG renders, and a machine-readable validation report out.

# /solidsight

Design 3D parts with code, then SEE and MEASURE what you made: every build
produces PNG renders from several angles plus a `report.json` with volume,
bounding box, shells, wall thickness, overhangs, sealed cavities and
part-to-part collisions/clearances. The loop is: write code -> build ->
inspect renders + report -> adjust -> repeat. Never trust geometry you have
not rendered and validated.

## What You Must Do When Invoked

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 0 - Ensure solidsight is installed

```bash
solidsight version || pip install "git+https://github.com/VortexJer/AISight#subdirectory=solidsight"
```

If the user gave you a checkout of the repo instead: `pip install ./solidsight`.
The first run self-installs this skill into `~/.claude/skills/solidsight`
and keeps it updated; `solidsight uninstall` removes the skill and the
package together.

### Step 1 - Write the bill of parts BEFORE any geometry code

Decompose the request into a short list of named functional parts and key
dimensions. Put it at the top of the model file as a comment:

```python
# bill of parts (mm):
#   base_plate  60 x 40 x 5, four M4 holes
#   wall        upright at back, 35 tall, two M4 holes
#   rib         triangular gusset tying wall to plate
```

Every part name here becomes an `emit(solid, name="...")` at the end of the
file. If you cannot write this list, you do not understand the request yet —
ask the user, do not guess geometry.

**A SPECIFIC referent = ALWAYS ask the detail question.** The
detail-mode question below is not only for engines and gearboxes: if
the request names or implies a particular real thing you cannot
imagine on its own — "my car", "a Porsche 911", a specific phone, a
specific machine — you MUST ask it every time, whatever the object.
Only generic requests with sensible defaults ("a mug", "a phone
stand") skip the question. If they choose detailed and gave no specs,
first pin down the exact variant (which model / year / trim), then
research it and tag every spec `[researched]`/`[standard]`/`[assumed]`
— never silently substitute your invented average of the category.

**Detail mode is OPT-IN — always ask first, never assume.** If the
request is a real technical object (engine, gearbox, housing, pump...)
and the user did not already say how faithful it must be, ask ONE
question before modeling: *representative model, or detailed functional
model (every bolt pattern, port, gallery, rib — takes notably longer)?*
The rules:

- Enter detailed mode ONLY on the user's explicit yes (or if they
  already used words like "detailed", "functional", "faithful",
  "replica"). Their silence, an ambiguous answer, or no reply =
  **representative**. Detailed mode costs real time and research;
  spending it uninvited is a bug, not diligence.
- Once confirmed: load `references/detail-mode.md`, replace the short
  bill of parts with a per-region **Feature Specification**, build and
  verify region by region. If the user gives no further specifications,
  research the object on the web yourself first and tag every spec line
  `[researched]`, `[standard]`, `[photo]` or `[assumed]`. For styled
  objects like a specific car, written specs barely exist — **fetch
  photos from several angles and work from them** (the from-image.md
  workflow with `--ref`, scale anchored on wheelbase/overall length);
  same fallback for any part whose drawing you cannot find.
- Detail lives in features (holes, bosses, flanges, tunnels, pockets):
  `parts.hole` (counterbore/countersink/chamfer/drill-point), `.aim()`
  for drilling into any face, `parts.bolt_circle`, patterns.

**If the user supplied a photo or drawing**, load `references/from-image.md`
first: LOOK at the image, estimate real dimensions with named anchors,
trace faithful flat shapes with `image_outline()`, reliefs with
`image_heightfield()`, and build with `--ref photo.png` so every build
writes a reference-vs-render comparison sheet to look at.

### Step 2 - Check the catalog before deriving geometry

Run `solidsight catalog`. Gears, threads, bolts, cap screws, washers, nuts,
bearings, shafts, timing pulleys, springs, NEMA motors, servos, T-slot
extrusions, lead screws, linear rails, hinges, snap clips, boxes with lids,
standoffs, honeycomb panels, and patterns already exist as tested parametric
parts. Composing catalog parts is always better than re-deriving an involute
or a helix from math. Full signatures and pairing rules: `references/parts-catalog.md`.

When the design uses a REAL purchased component, search the offline
database first: `solidsight components search "608 bearing"` returns the
standard's exact dimensions and the ready-made call
(`parts.component("bearing_608")`). Bought parts usually enter the scene as
ghost references: `place(parts.component("nema17", length=40), ghost=True)`.

### Step 3 - Build the model incrementally, in this order

1. Base forms first (`box`, `cylinder`, extruded/revolved sketches).
2. Features and cuts (holes, pockets, windows) via booleans.
3. Assembly positioning.
4. Rounding LAST (`round_corners` on 2D profiles is cheap; 3D `.fillet()` is
   expensive — apply once, at the end, if at all).

Core rules (full language reference: `references/design-language.md`):
- Units are mm, angles degrees. Same code always produces identical geometry.
- Primitives sit centered on XY with their base on Z=0 (the build plate).
- Booleans: `a + b`, `a - b`, `a & b`. Sketches extrude with `.extrude(h)`.
- **Overlap, never touch**: pieces that must fuse need >= 0.1 mm of shared
  volume; cutters must pierce >= 1 mm past the faces they cut. Coincident
  faces create zero-thickness seams and blind holes — solidsight warns when
  it detects them; take those warnings seriously.
- End the file with `emit(solid, name="snake_case_name")` per part.
- Attach SEMANTIC metadata to parts whose features matter downstream:
  `emit(p, name="plate", features=[{"type": "hole", "d": 5,
  "at": [10, 0, 6], "thru": True}])` — stored in report.json
  parts[].features, so consumers reason about meaning, not triangles.

**Iterating?** `solidsight watch model.py` rebuilds on every save (and
proves when an edit changed nothing), and `solidsight view model.py`
serves a live browser viewer — section planes, isolate, explode,
two-point measuring — that hot-reloads on each successful rebuild.

**Working for a human? ALWAYS give them the live preview.** As soon as
the first model file exists, launch `solidsight view model.py` in the
background and tell them it is open — they watch the design evolve
with every rebuild while you keep working from renders and
report.json. This is not optional and they should not have to ask.

### Step 4 - Build and LOOK after every geometric change

```bash
solidsight build model.py            # or --print-safe, see Step 6
```

Then, non-negotiable:
1. **Open the renders with the Read tool and actually look at them** (if you
   have vision): shape, proportions, holes where they belong, parts where
   they belong. The legend maps colors to part names; the footer gives exact
   bbox dimensions; the grid squares are 10 mm.
2. **Read the checks in report.json** (always, vision or not). Each check
   carries `where` (coordinates) and a `try:` suggestion.
3. If anything is off, fix the code and rebuild. Never declare a design
   finished without having built and inspected the LAST version of the code.

`--slice z=H` renders a filled cross-section — use it whenever inner walls,
pockets or fits are involved; outside views cannot show them.
`--focus X,Y,Z,R` zooms every view onto one feature — use it when a detail
(a hole, a clip, a boss) is too small to judge in the full-part frame.
Pick a view that FACES the feature (a +Y feature needs iso_back/back/left,
not the default iso) or you will zoom onto the part's far side.
After changing a model, `solidsight diff old_out new_out` lists exactly
what moved: per-part volume/size/wall deltas and checks that appeared or
disappeared — confirm your change did what you meant and nothing else.

### Step 5 - Use exact queries when looking is not enough

Renders answer "does it look right?". The query API answers "is it
geometrically right, with mathematical certainty" — and it works without
vision:

- A render looks solid but you must prove there is no sealed pocket inside:
  `solidsight query model.py voxels` (flood-fill cavity detection), or cast
  `ray` through the suspect line and count crossings (2 material segments
  where you expected 1 = cavity or second shell on that line).
- Verify a wall thickness at an exact plane: `section z=4` and read the `#`
  band widths (cell size is printed), or `ray` across the wall and read
  `material_segments[].thickness_mm`.
- Confirm a point is inside/outside a part: `point X Y Z` (e.g. checking a
  screw hole really pierces a boss).
- Layer-by-layer shape/symmetry check: `voxels --layer N`.

Interpretation guide for every field: `references/report-guide.md`.

### Step 6 - Choose the validation mode deliberately

- `--print-safe` — the part will be physically manufactured (FDM/resin).
  Enforces: watertight, one shell per part, min wall (default 1.2 mm), warns
  on overhangs past 50 deg and parts floating off the plate; FAILS on sealed
  internal cavities. Exit code 2 on failure.
- `--free` (default) — visual/artistic exploration. Same metrics reported,
  nothing enforced.

If the user says "print", "printable", "PLA", "resin", "manufacture" — use
`--print-safe` from the first build, not as a final afterthought.

### Step 7 - Assemblies: position, collide, measure, repeat

For multiple interacting parts (or checking fits between separately designed
parts):

```python
from solidsight import *
body  = from_model("../box/model.py", "box")   # reuse another model's part
motor = from_stl("nema17.stl")                 # import external mesh
place(body,  name="body")
place(motor, name="motor", at=(0, 0, 8), rotate=(0, 0, 90))
expect("motor", "body", status="touching")     # declare the INTENT
expect("motor", "lid", clearance=1.0)          # build FAILS if violated
```

Every multi-part build writes `pairs[]` into report.json: for each pair of
parts either the exact collision (overlap bbox + volume + a concrete move
suggestion) or the minimum clearance between their surfaces. **Declare every
fit that matters with `expect()`** (touching / clear / clearance range —
e.g. gear backlash `clearance=(0.15, 0.35)`): the report then answers
pass/fail against your intent instead of numbers you must re-judge each
iteration. Share dimensions between the assembly's model files through a
`params.py` next to them (`from params import *`). Iterate until:
- zero collisions, and
- every declared expectation is met (clearances 0.15-0.3 mm for printed
  sliding/snapping fits; "touching" only for parts meant to press together).

Keep-out zones and insertion paths: place reference volumes with
`place(..., ghost=True)` (measured in pairs[]/expect(), X-ray rendered,
never printed) and test insertions with `parts.swept(rigid_body, dz=-30)`
— sweep the RIGID body only and stop just above seating; snap-fit hooks
interfere by design (judge their overlap DEPTH, not contact).

Use `--exploded` to render mating faces, and `--slice` through the joint to
see engagement. Example of the full loop: `examples/05-assembly/`.

`solidsight assembly model.py` adds the BOM, per-axis play of fit chains
and a suggested bottom-up assembly sequence. When a printed part mates a
MACHINED one (bearing seat, shaft, dowel), get the real numbers from
`solidsight fit 8 H7 g6` (ISO 286). For mechanisms, declare
`joint(parent, child, type="revolute", axis=..., origin=..., limits=..., name="shoulder_pan")`
in the model: `solidsight robot` exports URDF/SDF with true masses and
inertia, and `solidsight motion` sweeps each joint through its limits and
reports the exact collision map (which angles hit what).

### Step 8 - Definition of done (checklist)

Do not report the task complete until ALL of these hold for the final code:

1. Renders from at least 4 angles reviewed (`iso,front,right,top`), plus a
   `--slice` through any internal feature.
2. `report.json` status is `ok`, or every remaining `warn` is explained to
   the user and accepted (e.g. supported overhangs).
3. Dimensions in the report's `scene.size` / part bboxes match the user's
   spec numbers — check them one by one against the bill of parts.
4. Assemblies: `pairs[]` shows zero collisions and sensible clearances.
5. One aesthetics pass on the renders: proportions, symmetry, consistent
   wall thicknesses, aligned features. Ugly-but-valid is not done.
6. If printing was requested: built with `--print-safe`, exit code 0, STL
   exported with `--stl`.

## Reference documents (load on demand)

- `references/design-language.md` — complete API: primitives, sketches,
  transforms, booleans, fillets, text, patterns, assembly helpers, common
  recipes and the errors you will hit.
- `references/parts-catalog.md` — every parametric part with signatures,
  pairing math and worked examples.
- `references/report-guide.md` — every report.json field and check id, what
  it means, how to fix it; query output interpretation.
- `references/detail-mode.md` — modeling real technical objects faithfully:
  the detail-level question, the Feature Specification method, and the
  feature -> toolbox mapping table. Load it whenever detailed mode applies.
- `references/platform.md` — the platform commands beyond build/query:
  watch, view, formats/convert, components, drawing, robot, motion,
  assembly/BOM, fit, explain, critique, cost, bench, plugins, events.
- `references/from-image.md` — modeling from a photo or drawing:
  size estimation with anchors, `image_outline()` / `image_heightfield()`,
  and the `--ref` comparison-sheet loop.

## Domain playbooks — load the ONE that matches (`domains/`)

Each is a full method for its domain: the numbers you may assume, the
build order, recipes, the specific failure modes, and its definition of
done. Load it right after the bill of parts. Do not load the others.

| load | when the request is |
|---|---|
| `domains/enclosures.md` | a box, PCB housing, bracket, jig, wall mount, adapter |
| `domains/mechanisms.md` | gears, linkages, robot joints, anything that moves |
| `domains/product-design.md` | a handheld/consumer shell, grip, ergonomics |
| `domains/furniture.md` | tables, shelves, chairs, frames, joinery, T-slot |
| `domains/architecture.md` | buildings, rooms, plans, massing, interiors |
| `domains/vehicles.md` | cars, bikes, boats, hulls, aircraft, drones |
| `domains/organic.md` | vases, sculpture, characters, props, flowing forms |
| `domains/terrain.md` | landscapes, heightmaps, procedural environments |
| `domains/jewelry-miniatures.md` | rings, pendants, miniatures, scale models |
| `domains/game-ready.md` | assets for a game engine (GLB, budgets, LODs) |
| `domains/toys.md` | toys, puzzles, board-game inserts (safety standards) |
| `domains/scientific.md` | molecules, lab fixtures, data made physical |

A playbook says WHAT to build and what to check; it never overrides the
loop above or the honesty rules below.

Worked examples with real reports and renders: `examples/01-mounting-bracket`
(simple), `02-snap-box` (booleans + snap fit), `03-gear-train` (catalog),
`04-vase` (organic, --free), `05-assembly` (collision found -> fixed),
`06-hidden-cavity` (cavity invisible in renders, caught by report + queries),
`07-engine-block` (detail mode: inline-4 from a feature specification),
`08-from-image` (a user's artwork traced with image_outline + --ref sheet).

## Honesty Rules

- Never present a design as done without building the final version of the
  code and looking at its renders/report.
- Never invent or estimate metrics — quote them from report.json.
- Never silence a FAIL by switching to --free; free mode is for exploration,
  not for making errors disappear. Surface every warn/fail to the user with
  its suggestion, even when you disagree with it.
- Never hand-edit STL/PNG/report outputs; they must be reproducible from the
  model file (same input -> byte-identical output).
- If the tool errors, show the user the real error text — it contains the
  location and a suggestion by design.
